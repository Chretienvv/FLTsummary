# Fundamentals of HTML 5
Introduction, Finding parts of the page, working wiht user input.

## Tips 
- Structural elements such as article, headers, main, footer,nav
- Form elements -> progress, datalist etc.
- Web components -> creating custom elements, storage and files e.a localstorage, real time communication e.a. api's backends etc.
- Fallbacks -> implementation that you fall back to if the standard is not available. Similar functionality as a native feature.
- Polyfills ->  Similar functinality but can easliy be removed in a later stage. 
- Validation can be done in HTML with the certain input types and attributes.
- CSS selectors can be user for validation input:valid + .invalid{visibility:hidden}
- Custom messages can be set in JavaScript or with the same trick as css selectors in combination with javascript.
- Local storage and session storage in the browser are usefull for storing information in the browser.

## Own opinion
Personally I don't like that user browser arent up to date. 
HTML 5 has a lot of improvements. Custom validation with forms is interesting. All though it might be difficult to choose one way of doing it.
