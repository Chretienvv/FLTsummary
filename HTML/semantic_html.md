# Semantic html
Semantic html and the difference between HTML 4 and 5. 
## Tips
- **Semantic Checklist**
    -  Is the html descriptive of the content?
    -  How is the content structured?
    - Are there elements purely used for presentaional use?

- Divs are okay if there is no other element that can be associated with it. 
- Divs are fine when you use it for sytling purposes.
- (HTML4) outlines - Implicit Sections -> Same level heading closes the previous level and starts a new section at the same time.
- (HTML4) outlines -Implicit sections -> a higher level closes that level and starts a new implicit one at a higher level.
- HTML5 outlines -> aside, section, article, nav.
- Heading elements should not be used for markup. Is it starting a new section? -> yes use the appropriate heading level tag.
- Text-level semantics e.a. the strong tag.
- Semantic Forms -> different input types, labels, fieldset, legend.

## Own opinion
Very usefull for accessibiliity reasons. Divs are nice for styling, but I see it a lot in production environments.
