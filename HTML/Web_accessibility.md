## Own opinion
Accessibility is important in the browser. It is easier when you immediately implement it. To get a higher level of WCAG it will be difficult to search for all the rules and implement them. Starting small if for now the best option. For instances alt attributes, DOM order and CSS rem,em,percentage.
